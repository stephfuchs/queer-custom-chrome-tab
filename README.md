# More queerness for your Google Chrome page of new tabs/windows

## Get to know the LGBTQIA+ community

This extension will change the page for a new tab / new page in _Google Chrome_ (version >= 88). It uses
the [Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/).

Every tab/window will be generated randomly, so you maybe a page appears, you'll already knew and maybe not. Kind fun,
huh?
